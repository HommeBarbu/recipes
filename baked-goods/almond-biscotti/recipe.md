# Almond Biscotti

Makes about 36 biscotti (3/4-inch-wide cookies)

## Ingredients

- 575g nsalted whole almonds (todo should be 18oz in weight.)
- 200g granulated sugar
- 200g light brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 2 teaspoons baking powder 4.5
- 400g all-purpose flour 400g
- 4 large eggs, plus 1 egg, lightly beaten, for brushing tops of loaves
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- 1/2 teaspoon almond extract

### Roasted Almonds

Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and pre-heat to 350 degrees.
Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper.
Place almonds in a single layer on a baking sheet and toast in the 350-degree oven for 10-15 minutes.
Remove and set aside.

### Biscotti Batter

Mix toasted almonds, cinnamon, brown sugar, white sugar, baking powder and flour.

In separate bowl, whisk eggs and then add vanilla and almond extract.

Add the wet mixture to the dry and mix slightly.

Then work the batter by hand.
It'll be sticky, flour those mitts.
Once the dough is firm, form a ball and divide into 4 equal pieces.

On a lightly floured surface, place 1 piece of dough, and using your hands, roll into a log shape that is approximately 
*8 inches long* and *2 inches wide* with a height of *3/4 of an inch*.
If it's sticky, simply dust your palms with more flour.
Repeat with remaining 3 pieces of dough.
Place 2 logs per baking sheet.

Brush loaves all over with lightly beaten egg.

### Bake

Bake for 36 minutes, rotating pans halfway through, or until the tops of the loaves are shiny and deep golden.
Cool on a rack for about 18 minutes before slicing.

### Cut

Place a loaf on a cutting board.
Using a large serrated knife, cut 3/4-inch-thick slices, either straight or on the diagonal.
Use a sawing motion to prevent crumbling.
Each loaf should yield 9 to 11 cookies.
If the cookie is crumbling, then let it cool a few more minutes.
Don't let it rest too long, however, or it could become too hard to slice.

Place slices on their sides back on the baking sheets.
Place in the still warm oven with the temperature off and the door closed for 30 to 60 minutes.
The longer they stay in the oven, the harder they will become.
Remove from oven and cool completely before storing in an airtight container, preferably a tin, which helps keep them crisp.
Stored properly, biscotti will last up to a month.
