# Almond Biscotti Notes

## Sunday July 17, 2016

First time making biscotti since Red Hook as well as my first time since trying to bake by weight.
Overall it went pretty smooth. A little slow to get back in and then converting some things to weight.
Also fell short an egg and had to make a quick run to Stewart's.

The dough is too dry to try and use 3 large eggs.
Maybe we could do less almonds?
See how they come out...
Cooked for 5 minutes less then called for, perhaps lower cooking time by 2 minutes for both rotations.
Cooled for 10 minutes before cutting.
Put cooling racks in oven for ten minutes.

Things different or of note:

- 1 tsp of cinnamon
- 1/2 tsp of almond extract.
- 18 oz of almonds
- Cooked almonds for 14 minutes @ 350. Allowed to site for less then 5 minutes,
wish I could have let them sit longer.
- The cookies were possibly over cooked, consider cutting a couple minutes off
each rotation.
