# Almond Biscotti Notes

## Sunday July 17, 2016

First time making biscotti since Red Hook as well as my first time since trying to bake by weight.
Overall it went pretty smooth. A little slow to get back in and then converting some things to weight.
Also fell short an egg and had to make a quick run to Stewart's.

### Lessons learned
The dough is too dry to try and use 3 large eggs.
Maybe we could do less almonds?
See how they come out...
