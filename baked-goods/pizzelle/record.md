# Baking notes

## December 18, 2016

- Cooled butter to about 100 degress.
- Brushed iron with butter before first batch.
- Scooped a little more than 1 tsp, using knife to drop.
- Cooked for about 1 minutes 55 seconds.
- I think I may be using to much batter, they are bigger then I want them to be.
- Try compressing iron by hand for first ten seconds to try and make them a little smaller.
