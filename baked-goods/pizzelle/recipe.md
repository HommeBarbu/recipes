# Pizzelles

Gram’s recipe (Marsilia Rampa)

## Ingredients

- 4 cups of flour
- 4 tsp baking powder
- 1 cup of sugar
- 1 cup butter, melted and cooled
- 6 eggs
- 2 oz vanilla extract
- 1 oz anise extract

## Directions

- Melt butter on low, remove from burner and let cool.
- Beat eggs and sugar in a large bowl.
- Add cooled melted butter, vanilla and anise. Mix well.
- Combine flour and baking powder.
- Add the dry mixture to the wet mixture about a 1/2 cup at a time. Stir well after each addition.

Heat the pizzlle iron.
If you have not used the iron yet, wipe it with a little butter so the pizzelles don’t stick.
Cook for just under two minutes.
When they are golden they will be ready.



## Tips from Theresa:

I try not to let the butter get too hot.
The hotter it gets the longer to cool off.
Must be cool or you will have scrambled eggs when added to the egg mixture.

I use a whisk for beating eggs and sugar as well as the butter and extracts.
You will have to change to a wooden spoon when adding the flour and the batter starts getting thick like dough.
I use a fork for step 4 just to combine the flour and baking powder.

When adding the dry mixture to the wet mixture you don’t have to measure the 1/2 cup.
I just use this cup as it is a good size/amount to add the flour.
Not too little at a time, not too much at a time.

The first batch may brown quickly because the iron is very hot.
It will adjust as you continue.
I use 2 teaspoons to scoop the dough and place on the iron.
You really have to stay with the iron as they bake quickly.
The dough will be a little sticky.
I do not measure as they come out different sizes.
I use a flat wooden spatula to lift off and place on a cooling rack.
I stack them as they cool.
I usually make them a day or two in advance to let them sit and get yummy.
They can certainly be eaten the same day.
