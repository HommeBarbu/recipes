# Blueberry Scones

## Ingredients

241g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
50g granulated sugar
12g baking powder
85g cold butter, cut into pieces
142g fresh blueberries
2 large eggs, beaten
57g vanilla yogurt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
11g grated lemon rind (zest), or 1/4 teaspoon lemon oil
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
36g sparkling white sugar, for sprinkling on top

## Instructions

Preheat the oven to 375°F.
 Lightly grease a baking sheet, or line with parchment.

Whisk the dry ingredients in a bowl.
 Add the butter and work it into the dry ingredients until the mixture is unevenly crumbly; use your fingers, a pastry blender, or an electric mixer.
 Gently mix the blueberries with the dry ingredients.

Stir together the eggs, yogurt, vanilla extract, lemon zest or oil, and almond extract.
 Add to the dry ingredients and stir very gently, just until combined.
 The dough will be quite moist, like cookie dough.

Use a muffin scoop, jumbo cookie scoop, or 1/4-cup measure to scoop the dough onto the prepared sheet in scant 1/4-cupfuls, leaving about 2" between each.

Liberally flour your counter and your hands. Take the dough out of the bowl and place it on the counter. Pat it into a 1" thick rectangle. Cut into 10 triangular scones. 
Place on a well-greased cookie sheet.
Brush the scones with melted butter, and sprinkle with sugar. 
Bake for 20 minutes, or until lightly browned and a cake tester inserted into a scone comes out dry. 
Cool completely on a rack.

Brush each ball of dough with a bit of milk or cream (or butter?), and sprinkle with coarse sparkling sugar.

Bake the scones for 20 to 24 minutes, or until lightly browned and a cake tester or toothpick inserted into a scone comes out dry.
 Remove from the oven, and serve warm.
 To reheat, wrap loosely in aluminum foil, and bake in a preheated 350°F oven for about 8 to 10 minutes.

Store scones, well wrapped, at room temperature for several days.
 Freeze for longer storage.
