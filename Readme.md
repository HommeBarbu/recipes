# John's Recipes

I was thinking of an easy way to track recipes as well as keep a record of past attempts and alterations. 

Recipes will be stored in folders for each item under a broad category. For example:

Almond biscotti would be classified as a baked good. So I'll put a recipe in a folder called *almond-biscotti* under the category *baked-goods*.

There will also be a file alongside the recipe that will record some thoughts on choice cooking/baking sessions.
